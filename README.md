# MPI using different approaches

- [master-slave](./master-slave) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)))
- [divide-and-conquer](./divide-conquer) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm))
- [domain-decomposition](./domain-decomposition) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_decomposition_methods))

Each approach has a folder called `bubble-sort`, where you can find the sequential and MPI implementations. The `report` folder is where you will find a report detailing what we have done and the results.
